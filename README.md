## Welcome to the Sceneri Issue Tracker!

This repository is here to share updates with the community about the bugs reported in Sceneri and how they’re being handled.

### Why aren’t feature requests shown here?

To keep things streamlined and clear, this section focuses strictly on tracking and fixing bugs. If you have a suggestion for a new feature, we’d love to hear it! You can join the discussion on our Discord server, where the community and dev team can give it the attention it deserves.

### Why won’t everything be addressed?

Sceneri is a large and intricate project, and with so many helpful bug reports coming in, we sometimes have to prioritize. You might notice certain bugs marked as “Won’t Fix” or “Won’t Do.” Here’s why that might happen:

- Fixing it would add too much complexity to the engine without enough benefit.
- That part of the engine might already be scheduled for a future update.
- It’s not something we can realistically work on in the near future.
